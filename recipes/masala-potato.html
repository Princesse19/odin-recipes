    <p>Potatoes are rich in vitamin C, which is an antioxidant. Potatoes were a life-saving food source in early 
        times because the vitamin C prevented scurvy. Another major nutrient in potatoes is potassium, an 
        electrolyte which aids in the workings of our heart, muscles, and nervous system.
